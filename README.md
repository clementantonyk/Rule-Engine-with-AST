# Rule Engine with Abstrat Syntax Tree

## Overview
The Rule Engine with AST is designed to dynamically create, modify, and evaluate rules for determining user eligibility based on specific attributes like age, department, income, and spend. The system uses an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) to represent conditional rules and allows for efficient combination and modification of rules.

## Features

- Dynamically creates rules as Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs) from user input.
- Combines multiple rules into a single optimized AST for evaluation.
- Evaluates rules against user attributes and returns eligibility based on the rule logic.
- Supports advanced conditions with user-defined functions within the rule language.
- Includes error handling for invalid rule strings or data formats.
Incorporates validations for attributes using a predefined catalog.
Flexible data model for rules storage and modification.
